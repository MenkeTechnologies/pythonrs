### `[PYTHON, COMPILED TO BYTECODE — rkyv-CACHED ON EVERY RUN, AOT-NATIVE]`

> *"CPython compiles to its own bytecode and walks it. pythonrs lowers Python to a shared machine, caches the result on every run, and can bake a script into a native binary."*

**pythonrs** is Python as a [`fusevm`](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/fusevm)
frontend — a lexer/parser and compiler that lowers Python 3 to `fusevm::Chunk`
bytecode running on the fusevm three-tier Cranelift JIT, over a `PyHost` object
heap. There is no bespoke VM and no bespoke JIT: pythonrs is a pure front end;
execution and codegen live in `fusevm` — the same engine behind
[`zshrs`](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/zshrs),
[`strykelang`](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/strykelang),
[`awkrs`](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/awkrs),
[`vimlrs`](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/vimlrs),
[`elisprs`](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/elisprs), and
[`rubylang`](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/rubylang).

It is, to our knowledge, the first compiled standalone Python runtime that both
**transparently caches bytecode via rkyv on every run** and **AOT-compiles a
script to a native executable**.

## [0x00] OVERVIEW

pythonrs keeps Python the language and throws away CPython's execution model. It
lexes and parses Python to an AST, lowers the AST to `fusevm` bytecode, and runs
the bytecode on a stack VM with a Cranelift JIT. Arithmetic and comparisons lower
to native ops; Python-specific behavior — truthiness, `str`/`list` concat, bignum
promotion, attribute and method dispatch — runs through a strict numeric hook and
a numbered builtin-call protocol into the `PyHost` object heap.

Two things set it apart from every other standalone Python:

- **Transparent rkyv bytecode cache — on every run.** `python foo.py` hashes the
  source, consults `~/.pythonrs/scripts.rkyv`, and on a hit runs the compiled
  chunks directly with lex/parse/lower skipped entirely. No flags, no separate
  build step, no `__pycache__` ritual.
- **AOT to a native executable.** `python --build foo.py` emits a standalone
  native binary (via `fusevm::aot`, linked against the pythonrs runtime
  staticlib) that runs the script with no interpreter present.

## [0x01] INSTALL

```sh
# Via the Homebrew tap (bumped by each release; formula is `pythonrs`)
brew install menketechnologies/menketech/pythonrs

# Or from source
git clone https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/pythonrs
cd pythonrs && cargo build --release
# binary: target/release/python  (+ libpythonrs.a for AOT linking)
```

#### Zsh tab completion

```sh
cp completions/_python "${fpath[1]}/"
# or: fpath=(/path/to/pythonrs/completions $fpath) in .zshrc
```

## [0x02] USAGE

```sh
python foo.py               # run a script (transparently rkyv-cached)
python -c 'print(1 + 1)'    # run a one-liner
python --build foo.py       # AOT-compile to a native ./foo executable
python --dump-bytecode f.py # print the lowered fusevm bytecode
python --repl               # interactive REPL
python --lsp                # Language Server Protocol over stdio
```

Set `PYTHONRS_TRACE=1` to log cache hit/miss to stderr (silent otherwise).

## [0x03] LANGUAGE FEATURES

Arbitrary-precision integers, real closures, classes with inheritance, operator
dunders, generators (`yield` / `yield from` / lazy generator expressions, backed
by stackful `corosensei` coroutines), `match`/`case` structural pattern matching,
own-scope comprehensions (list/dict/set) and proper `nonlocal`, f-strings,
exceptions, and full call-site and literal `*` / `**` unpacking. The `PyHost`
heap implements the `str` / `list` / `dict` / `tuple` / `set` / instance object
model with the operator, attribute, item, and iteration protocols. See
[\[0x07\]](#0x07-status--roadmap) and [BUGS.md](BUGS.md) for the honest list of
what is not yet implemented.

## [0x04] COMMAND-LINE FLAGS

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| *(none)* | Run the script/one-liner, transparently rkyv-cached. |
| `--build` | AOT-compile the script to a standalone native executable. |
| `--dump-bytecode` | Print the lowered `fusevm` bytecode and exit. |
| `--repl` | Start the interactive REPL. |
| `--lsp` | Run the Language Server Protocol server over stdio. |

## [0x05] ARCHITECTURE

```
lexer  →  parser  →  AST  →  compiler  →  fusevm::Chunk  →  fusevm VM + JIT
                                              │                    │
                                              └── CallBuiltin ─────→ host (PyHost heap)
```

- `lexer.rs` — indentation-significant tokenizer (INDENT/DEDENT/NEWLINE, f-strings).
- `parser.rs` — recursive-descent Python grammar → `ast.rs`.
- `compiler.rs` — lowers the AST to fusevm ops + `CallBuiltin` dispatches.
- `host.rs` — the `PyHost` object heap (str/list/dict/tuple/set/instances/…), the
  operator/attribute/item/iteration semantics, and the fusevm run plumbing.
- `builtins.rs` — the `CallBuiltin` handler table, the numeric hook, the Kernel
  builtin functions (`print` / `len` / `range` / …), and per-type methods.
- `cache.rs` — the rkyv-shard bytecode cache.
- `aot_native.rs` — native-executable emission via `fusevm::aot`.

## [0x06] PARITY HARNESS

Correctness is measured, not asserted: an example corpus runs through both
pythonrs and the reference `python3`, and the output is diffed byte-for-byte.
pythonrs runs a large, real subset of Python 3, verified against CPython on that
corpus.

Beyond the fixed corpus, the `parity-fuzz` binary is a differential fuzzer. It
generates thousands of grammar-driven, deterministic-output snippets — biased
toward the historically fragile areas (float `repr`, integer `//`/`%` sign
rules, bignum, slices, the `format` mini-language, string methods) — runs each
through `python -c` and the reference `python3 -c`, and reports every case where
stdout or accept/reject diverges. Each case is seeded, so any divergence is
delta-debugged to a minimal reproducer and replays exactly:

```sh
cargo build --bin parity-fuzz
./target/debug/parity-fuzz --count 5000          # fuzz every mode
./target/debug/parity-fuzz --formatspec          # one surface only
./target/debug/parity-fuzz --seed 51 --once      # replay + minimize one case
```

The generator never emits nondeterministic output, so every reported divergence
is a real gap. `PYTHONRS_FUZZ_PYTHON` names the reference interpreter; a
`--baseline` allowlist keeps known gaps from failing while new ones exit non-zero.

## [0x07] STATUS & ROADMAP

Active, in development. The runtime executes a substantial real subset of Python
3. [BUGS.md](BUGS.md) is the honest ledger of unimplemented features — `async`,
`bytes` operations, and most of the standard library are not yet carried. A DAP
debug adapter (`--dap`) — source-line and function breakpoints, stepping, call
stack, locals, and expression `evaluate` — ships today, alongside man pages and
the generated `reference.html`.
